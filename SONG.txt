I wanted to write about a card player
a gambler who gambles not to win but to try and figure out something
to figure out some kind of mystical logic in luck,
or chance 
some kind of scientific
He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He don't play for respect
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart**
